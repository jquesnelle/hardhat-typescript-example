# hardhat-typescript-example

This repository contains a fully functional example of using TypeScript with Hardhat, including several extensions I've found useful.
Neccessary configuration variables are stored in a `.env`

## Deploying a contract

Deploy a contract and perform initalization via a resumable script with [hardhat-deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy).

```shell
npx hardhat deploy
```

To customize the deployment, see the script in `deploy/`. Deployments are saved to `deployments/` 

### Verifying contact source on Etherscan

Contract source code can be verified on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) if an API key is provided.

```shell
npx hardhat verify <contract address>
```

### Publishing ABIs

Publish contract ABIs with [hardhat-etherscan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan) so other applications can easily integrate with your contracts.

```shall
npx hardhat export-abi
```

Contract ABIs will be exported to `abis`/ which are suitable for committing.

## Testing a contract

Contracts can be easily tested with a mix of [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha), [chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai), and [waffle](https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle) -- see `test/`. When using Visual Studio Code, individual tests can be run or debugged from the GUI by installing [Mocha Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-mocha-test-adapter).

If desired a gas usage report can be generated by setting `REPORT_GAS=true`, and quoted in USD if a [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com) API key is provided.

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

```

## Interacting with a contract

Deployed contracts can be interacted with programatically -- see `scripts/`. 

```shell
npx hardhat run ./scripts/interact.ts
```
